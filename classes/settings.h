/*! A class that gives access to settings

Used to save the last used dialog settings.
Uses QSettings internally.
Compatible with the settings used in the Maemo versions.
Time Control is passed as int due to a QML problem, but *must* be a valid WrappedClocksWidget::TimeControlType enum to work.
(All other values are interpreted as "Normal Clock")
